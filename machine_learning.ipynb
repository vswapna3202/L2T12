For a self-driving car it is important for machine learning algorithm to know what the obstructions are in front of car or from side say a car crossing lane, it should use lane dimensions so it can stay within its lane, it should know speed limit so car can stay within speed limit. So all these will be inputs based on these inputs the alogrithm will decide exact outputs to produce. Outputs will be steering the car as per the lane dimensions and layouts, braking the car if the car in front slows down or another car is crossing lanes in front, controlling accleration as per speed limit prescribed for the road travelling on.\n","2. For NetFlix recommendations, it is important for algorithm to know what the previous history of the user was and what they liked watching previously the most, say particular genres or particular actors/actresses etc, data of what similar users with same likes liked watching, what the current content or listing is in NF. These all will be inputs. Based on these inputs the algorithm will decide the outputs by showing listings based on similar users watchlists, current or recent listings on genres or other criteria liked by user based on his previous history. All contents output would be available to view currently on NF.\n","3. For signature recognition we need samples of as many genuine signatures and samples of as many forged signatures as inputs. The algorithm needs to find the markings and differences between genuine and forged signatures. This learning will be used to identify real time signature as either genuine or marked based on previous learnings and patterns of identifications and then this would be the output as either genuine or forged.\n","4. For medical diagnosis inputs need to be symptoms, diagnosis and tests for various illnesses. The algorithm would narrow down the current illness based on symptoms of all illness which it has and previous diagnosises of similar symptoms illnesses. It will then match the test data to the test, symptoms and diagnostic learning it has and find the distinct illness which matches the current illness. Output would the diagnosis of the illness based on the learnings.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"l_I2f4C85yNF"},"source":["\n","2.

Answer here\n","* 3.1 It is appropriate to use unsupervised machine learning algorithm as we do not have prior knowledge of specific anomaly patterns. Therefore, using a supervised algorithm using labelled data for training would not be possible. Also, anomalies represent deviations from normal behaviour so an unsupervised algorithm would be better to use here as the behaviour is not normal pattern and may not be understood well before.\n","* 3.2 It is appropriate to use supervised machine learning algorithm here as we need to predict customer lifetime value which is a numerical value but this is arrived using historical transaction data and customer demographics.

Answer here\n","* 4.1 Yes, it would be correct to utilise semi-supervised learning algorithm. The labelled data would have a transaction marked as either fradulent or genuine. So this data can be used as a training model. It provides foundation for algorithm to understand if a transaction is genuine or fradulent.But, in real world transactions there would be more of genuine transactions than fraudlent transactions which would be rare. In such scenario where there is scarcity of a labelled input semi supervised learning would help by looking at the data and capturing subtle patterns and unseen instances not shown by the labelled data alone. Since the data set is imbalanced with more genuine transactions and less fradulent transactions and a need to predict fradulent transactions it is better to use semi supervised learning algorithm.\n","* 4.2 Yes, it would be correct to utilise semi-supervised learning algorithm. As the labelled data is only a small portion of the data, even though limited would provide valuable information about customer satisfaction. It would serve as a foundation to predict satisfaction reatings. Semi-supervised learning would allow inclusion of unlabelled data in the training process. By using both labelled and unlabelled data it would be easier to capture nuances in the customer feedback.\n","* 4.3 It is appropriate to use a supervised algorithm here. The dataset contains mostly labelled emails.This provides substantial amount of data for learning whether an email is a spam or not. So this learning can be used based on existing patterns from labelled data to identify future emails and categorise them as a spam or not\n","* 4.4 It is appropriate to use a supervised algorithm here. The dataset would contain predefined information of the credit card applicants previous financial history and credit-card related information. Patterns for defaulting could be understood based on this data and this learning could be applied to the customer's prediction patterns of whether they would default or not."]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}

## Machine Learning Problem Analysis

### Overview
This task involves analyzing various machine learning problems and determining the most appropriate algorithms and approaches to solve them.

### Instructions

#### Input and Output Analysis
1. **Describe Input and Output:**
    - **Self-Driving Car:** Input could include sensor data from cameras, LiDAR, radar, GPS, etc., and the output would be commands for steering, acceleration, and braking.
    - **Netflix Recommendation System:** Input includes user viewing history, ratings, genre preferences, and output would be personalized recommendations.
    - **Signature Recognition:** Input involves scanned or captured signature images, and the output would be the identified signature owner.
    - **Medical Diagnosis:** Input comprises patient symptoms, medical history, diagnostic test results, and output would be the identified medical condition or disease.

### Regression vs. Classification
2. **Case Studies and Algorithm Choice:**
    - **Email Classification:** Classification algorithm is suitable as it categorizes emails into distinct classes (promotional or social) based on content and metadata.
    - **Stock Price Forecasting:** Regression algorithm is appropriate as it predicts a continuous numerical value (stock price) based on historical data and trends.
    - **Animal Image Sorting:** Classification algorithm is suitable as it assigns images to specific categories (animal species) based on visual features.
    - **Medical Disease Prediction:** Classification algorithm is suitable as it predicts the likelihood of a binary outcome (presence or absence of disease) based on medical history and test results.

### Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning
3. **Real-World Problems and Learning Approach:**
    - **Anomaly Detection in Manufacturing:** Unsupervised learning is suitable as it identifies anomalies in sensor data without prior knowledge of specific patterns.
    - **Customer Lifetime Value Prediction:** Supervised learning is appropriate as it predicts a target variable (customer lifetime value) based on labeled historical transaction data and demographics.
    - **Customer Segmentation:** Unsupervised learning is suitable as it clusters customers based on purchase history, browsing behavior, and preferences without labeled data.
    - **Social Media Post Categorization:** Unsupervised learning is suitable as it groups posts into different themes based on similarities without labeled data.

### Semi-Supervised Learning
4. **Real-World Problems and Semi-Supervised Learning:**
    - **Fraudulent Financial Transactions:** Appropriate as the dataset contains labeled instances of fraud and non-fraud transactions.
    - **Customer Satisfaction Surveys:** Inappropriate due to the small portion of labeled data; better suited for supervised learning.
    - **Spam Email Detection:** Appropriate as the majority of emails are labeled, facilitating semi-supervised learning.
    - **Credit Card Default Prediction:** Inappropriate as the dataset likely contains sufficient labeled data for supervised learning.
